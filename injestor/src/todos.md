# Todo's


### Immediate:
* Make properties shrink and grow on drag
* Allow properties attach to nodes and literals
* Have circles on edges of property to show where to click and if it is attached
* Have circles showing attach indicator
* Do above but respectively for qualifiers
* Add knowledge graph components (i.e. search, editing, binding)


### Later tasks:

* remove transparency on drag
* make stack like layering for elements

# Notes

* The target id for dragged item event, is it always what we want
* Is the state being updated correctly with the graph copying on drop
