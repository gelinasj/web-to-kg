# Web to Knowledge Graph

This is a chrome extension to extract and convert web data to a format that
can be uploadable to a knowledge graph. To run the tool:

1. Run `./buildTool` from the project root
2. Navigate to extension management page at `chrome://extensions/`
3. Click `Load unpacked` and select the `build/` directory in the project root
that was generated by the build script
4. At this point the extension should now be available in the extensions dropdown
in the upper-right section of the chrome window. To run, simply click the extension
in this dropdown
